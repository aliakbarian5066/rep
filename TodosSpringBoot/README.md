# To Do List web application using Spring Boot

A simple Todo list application using Spring Boot with the following options:

- Spring JPA and MySQL for data persistence
- Spring MVC for the rendering.

To build and run the sample from a fresh clone of this repo:

## Configure MySQL

1. Create a database in your MySQL instance.
2. Update the application.properties file in the `src/main/resources` folder with the URL, username and password for your MySQL instance. The table schema for the Todo objects will be created for you in the database.
